**Data from WCRP internationally coordinated experiments hosted in the ENES Data Federation.**

**The ENES Climate Data Infrastructure provides access to model data from the WCRP internationally coordinated experiments CMIP and CORDEX.** 

**CMIP, the [Coupled Model Intercomparison Project](https://www.wcrp-climate.org/wgcm-cmip)**, provides a common set of numerical experiments for global climate models with the objectives to evaluate models, lead to improvements in the model simulations and provide a better understanding of past, present and future climates.

**CORDEX, [the Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiments](https://cordex.org/)**, provides a framework to evaluate regional climate model performance through a set of experiments aiming at producing regional climate projections.

Find here useful information on different databases and on the projects they originate from:


### [CMIP6](https://is-enes3.github.io/IS-ENES-Website/sdm-which-model-data-detailed#cmip6-detailed)
The Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 providing the scientific basis for the [IPCC 6th Assesment report (AR6, 2021)](https://www.ipcc.ch/assessment-report/ar6/) 

### [CMIP5 & AR5](https://is-enes3.github.io/IS-ENES-Website/sdm-which-model-data-detailed#cmip5-detailed)
The Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 and a subset of its results providing the scientific basis for the [IPCC 5th Assessment Report (AR5, 2013)](https://www.ipcc.ch/assessment-report/ar5/)

### [CORDEX-CMIP5](https://is-enes3.github.io/IS-ENES-Website/sdm-which-model-data-detailed#cordex-detailed)
The Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment based on CMIP5 forcing.

### [CMIP3 & AR4](https://is-enes3.github.io/IS-ENES-Website/sdm-which-model-data-detailed#cmip3-detailed)
A subset of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 3 results providing the scientific basis for the [IPCC 4th Assessment Report (AR4, 2007)](https://www.ipcc.ch/assessment-report/ar4/).
