### Data processing tools for experienced users

***Advanced data processing functionalities within the ENES data infrastructure***

| **ESMValTool** A software for model diagnostics and evaluation. [ESMValTool](https://www.esmvaltool.org/) facilitates the characterization of CMIP Diagnostic, Evaluation and Characterization of Klima (DECK) and historical simulations. It is currently implemented in the back-end data processing of the Copernicus Climate Data Store ([CDS](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/#!/home)). Web accessible processing capabilities are under development within the ENES infrastructure project IS-ENES3. Information on available derived data products for the CMIP6 can be found [here](https://is-enes3.github.io/IS-ENES-Website/sdm-processing-tools-data#deriveddataproduct). |

| **Indice Calculation CLIMate** ([ICCLIM](https://icclim.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)) A software being developed as a back-end tool for the [Climate4Impact](https://climate4impact.eu/impactportal/general/index.jsp) portal as well as being used to generate climate indices for CMIP6. |

| **Climate Data Operators** (CDO)[INTERNAL LINK TO ADD] A collection of command line operators to manipulate and analyze climate and numerical weather prediction model data. Supported data formats are GRIB 1/2, NetCDF 3/4, SERVICE, EXTRA and IEG. |

| **Birdhouse** A software framework containing a collection of web processing services. [Birdhouse](http://bird-house.github.io/) supports institutions to customize the implementation of processing services allowing users to remotely process the institution hosted data from their laptop. It is developed as an open source project that follows the Open Geospatial Consortium standards. It delivers access to hosted processing to the Copernicus Climate Change Service [CP4CDS](https://cp4cds.github.io/) project, among others. |


### <a name="deriveddataproduct"></a> Derived data products
 
Within the phase 3 of the IS-ENES project the following features will be developed and provided based on the [ESMValTool](https://www.esmvaltool.org/):
- routine statistics
- compute services
- access to derived data products

See the Models & Tools section to find more information for developers.
