## Welcome to the IS-ENES3 project
### Infrastructure for the European Network for Earth System Modelling (01/2019 – 03/2023)

IS-ENES3, an Horizon 2020 project, is the third phase of the distributed e-infrastructure of the European Network for Earth System Modelling (ENES). 

**IS-ENES3:** 
-	delivers the research infrastructure providing access to climate model data and tools to boost the understanding of past, present and future climate variability and changes.
-	contributes to speeding up the development and use of models of the Earth’s complex climate system in Europe by sharing models, tools and expertise.
-	supports the international standards and data services of the World Climate Research Program coordinated experiments for global and regional climate models **[CMIP](https://www.wcrp-climate.org/wgcm-cmip)** (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project), with a focus on CMIP6, and **[CORDEX](https://cordex.org/)** (Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiments). 

The project gathers 22 partners, combining expertise in climate modelling, computational science, data management, climate impacts and climate services.
