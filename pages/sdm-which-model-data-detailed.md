### <a name="cmip6-detailed"></a>CMIP6: Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6

The [WGCM Infrastructure Panel](https://www.wcrp-climate.org/wgcm-cmip/wgcm-cmip6) is the official CMIP6 document home. CMIP6 is essentially a continuation and extension of CMIP5. Forcing data for CMIP6 and other MIP projects are already in the Earth System Grid Federation ESGF under project input4MIPs (emission scenarios included).

**Information for Data Users:**

- [CMIP6 Guidance for Data Users](https://pcmdi.llnl.gov/CMIP6/Guide/dataUsers.html)
- [Search and Download ESGF tutorial](https://esgf.github.io/esgf-user-support/user_guide.html) to access data from the ESGF portals.
- [CMIP6 Data Request](https://clipc-services.ceda.ac.uk//dreq/mipVars.html) contains the list of short names for variables with their standard names, long names, units, and some explanations. Find the spreadsheet here.

**Information for Modelers:**

- [CMIP6 Participation Guidance for Modelers](https://pcmdi.llnl.gov/CMIP6/Guide/modelers.html)

### <a name="cmip5-detailed"></a>CMIP5 & AR5

**Information on the data from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 - CMIP5 and on the subset used for the IPCC-AR5**

[CMIP5](https://pcmdi.llnl.gov/mips/cmip5/) is the 5th phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) promoted by the WCRP's Working Group on Coupled Modelling ([WGCM](https://www.wcrp-climate.org/wgcm-cmip/wgcm-cmip5)).

**Access to CMIP5 Data** 

CMIP5 are available at the Earth System Grid Federation (ESGF) which is the official WGCM repository. Other distribution centers can be found here.

**AR5 Database**

The IPCC has used CMIP5 Data as the scientific basis for its [5th Assessment Report (AR5)](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar5/syr/). The AR5 Database is based on the status of CMIP5 data on March 15, 2013.

**Access to AR5 Data**

CMIP5 data are also accessible via the IPCC Data Distribution Center (DDC).

### <a name="cordex-detailed"></a>CORDEX-CMIP5

**Information on the data from the COordinated Regional climate Downscaling EXperiment - CORDEX**


CORDEX provides global coordination of regional climate downscaling for improved regional climate change adaptation and impact assessment. IS-ENES, the infrastructure project for ENES, works in close cooperation with CORDEX to manage the data collection, quality control, data publishing, and data dissemination via the ENES data federation.

### <a name="cmip3-detailed"></a>CMIP3 & AR4

**The Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase three, provided the scientific basis for the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (AR4).**

Under the [World Climate Research Programme (WCRP)](https://www.wcrp-climate.org/), the Working Group on Coupled Modelling ([WGCM](https://www.wcrp-climate.org/wgcm-overview)) established the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) as a standard experimental protocol for studying the output of coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation models (AOGCMs). CMIP provides a community-based infrastructure in support of climate model diagnosis, validation, intercomparison, documentation and data access. This framework enables a diverse community of scientists to analyze GCMs in a systematic fashion, a process which serves to facilitate model improvement. Virtually the entire international climate modeling community has participated in this project since its inception in 1995. CMIP3 data are in the ESGF now.

Phase three of CMIP ([CMIP3](https://pcmdi.llnl.gov/mips/cmip3/)) included "realistic" scenarios for both past and present climate forcing. The research based on this dataset provided much of the new material underlying the [Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)](https://www.ipcc.ch/) Fourth Assessment Report (AR4).
