The main objective of this work package (WP) is to ensure an effective, smooth and high-quality implementation of the project, with respect to both general administrative and management practices that are expected for projects funded via the EC programmes, and with respect to financial management.

The coordination work package is under the responsibility of the Coordinator assisted by the European Project Manager.
