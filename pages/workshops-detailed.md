### <a name="cfworkshop2022"></a>2022 CF Workshop

2022 CF Workshop will take place on 13-15 September 2022 hosted by [IFCA](https://ifca.unican.es/en-us) at Santander (Spain). After 2 successful virtual editions (2020 and 2021), the 2022 edition is organized as a hybrid event having in-person and on-line participants.

The Climate and Forecast metadata conventions (CF) are a community-developed standard designed to promote the processing and sharing of climate and forecast model and observational output data, and derived data products. The conventions define metadata that provide a definitive description of what the data in each variable represents, and the spatial and temporal properties of the data. This enables users of data from different sources to decide which quantities are comparable, and facilitates building applications with powerful extraction, regridding, and display capabilities. The CF convention includes a standard name table, which defines strings that identify physical quantities.

**Find all the information (including the agenda) and the registration procedure on the event [official webpage](http://cfconventions.org/Meetings/2022-Workshop.html).**
Registration deadline: 30 August 2022

### <a name="climate-indices"></a>Workshop "Climate Indices-Eastern European perspective"
**Sep 27, 2021** from 11:00 AM to 03:00 PM

![EEclimateindicesworkshop](../images/Eastern_Europe_banner_vf2.png)

The IS-ENES3 consortium organizes an online workshop ‘Climate indices - Eastern European perspective’. The workshop will **be an online effort to collect information on the current status about usage and implementation of different climate indices in the region, which will be the starting point to draft requirements and recommendations for the future**. It will be organized as two online meetings, combined with online surveys and online interviews between them.

- **Initial meeting**: 17th May, 2021 (9:30 AM to 12:00 PM CEST)
- **Survey and interview** : June and July, 2021
- **Final workshop**: 27th September, 2021 (11:00 AM to 3:00 PM CEST)

**The aim of the workshop?** Used by a broad user community for many applications outside the climate science community, climate indices provide compact information on key physical parameters. A reference specification of the indices has been developed by joint CCl/CLIVAR/JCOMM Expert Team (ET) on Climate Change Detection and Indices (ETCCDI), and these have been implemented in the ICCLIM tool and many others. The workshop will evaluate and review the usage of existing indices and explore the need for additional ones in these broader and new communities.

**Who organizes it?**  Researchers from the IS-ENES3 consortium. These researchers will interact directly with the workshop participants. Beside many activities, IS-ENES3 project aims at further engaging with the community of users of IS-ENES services, by widening the user base through training, engaging the community in co-constructing standards and expressing needs, and engaging the younger generation in interdisciplinary approaches.

**For whom?** This workshop is for climate scientists and researchers from different disciplines (agriculture, forestry, water resources, public health etc) that often use different climate indices. We aim to create a mix of different disciplines so that recommendations will follow needs from broad research communities.

**What is the programme?** The initial online meeting will be organized to present the main goals and planned output of the final workshop together with the discussion on current status and potential future developments. After the meeting the online survey will be initialized together with online interviews, from which a set of recommendations will be drafted. The topics related to the climate indices that will be covered are: indices definition and usage, data sources, software for calculation and visualization, current gaps and limitations.

![CFConventions](../images/banner_v3_CFConvention.png)

**Find [here](https://zenodo.org/record/3900253#.YmAy_9pBxaR) the Wrap-up and Conclusions of the 2020 CF Workshop !**

**The Climate and Forecast (CF) metadata convention for netCDF (netCDF-CF)** is a community-developed standard first released in 2003. The CF conventions were originally developed to represent climate and forecast model output encoded in the netCDF binary format, with the specific goal of facilitating comparison of output from different models. Subsequent development of the convention has broadened its scope to include observational data and derived products.

Because of the COVID-19 pandemic situation, the meeting will be virtual from the **9th to 11th of June 2020**. The meeting will only run for 3 hours on each day: 16:00 - 19:00 UTC, followed by a short purely social time for those who can, and want to, stay on.

### <a name="ESGF-WS"></a>ESGF Future Architecture Workshop
- When: **Nov 05, 2019 09:00 AM to Nov 07, 2019 05:30 PM (Europe/Vienna / UTC100)**
- Where: **Abingdon (UK)**

![ESGFArchitecture](../images/esgf_vf.png)

**ESGF Future Architecture Meeting is a project meeting to review the existing system architecture, examine requirements for a future system and propose new solutions.**

**About this Event**
It is now nearly ten years since the original ESGF system was designed. At that time the development was driven by the need to create a globally distributed archive for downloading CMIP data. Since that time, there have been a number of changes: ESGF has grown and diversified in the number of projects and disciplines it supports; the operational requirements are clearer for the ESGF to support an international federated archive of this size; many of the ESGF nodes now have other functions beyond CMIP and there has also been changing landscape of data repository and science needs. This meeting has been convened by the ESGF Executive Committee (ESGF-XC) with the purpose of re-assessing the requirements and developing a future architecture for the system.

**Meeting Structure**
The meeting will run over three days. Attendance is by invitation only and concentrates on ESGF key developers.
The programme for the meeting has been specified by Philip Kershaw (UKRI STFC, local host), Ghaleb Abdullah (LLNL) and Ben Evans (NCI) on behalf of the ESGF-XC. In addition to requirements analysis, technology survey and review high-level architecture the programme concentrates on the topical areas:
- User experience
- Data repository and management
- Compute on data
- Platforms, system administration
The meeting aims to agree on a roadmap for future architecture directions in ESGF. The meeting results will be presented and discussed at the upcoming ESGF Face-to Face Conference in March 2020 in Toulouse.

**Sponsorship**
This workshop is sponsored by IS-ENES3, which has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No 824084, and co-organised by the ESGF-XC and IS-ENES.

- Handling of open pull requests (ESMValCore, ESMValTool)
- Handling of different vertical coordinates in CMIP6 (hybrid level)
- CMORization of observational data (e.g. unify ERA5 cmorizers)
- Naming convention of CMIP3 data
- Complete documentation
- Identify and fill existing gaps
- Sort (by title) and group (by theme) scientific documentation of diagnostics
- Merging strategy for the “EMAC quicklook” branch (import capability of native EMAC output and run-time monitoring features)
- Complete set of fix files for CMIP6 models

In addition, a [draft roadmap for the ESMValTool development](https://www.esmvaltool.org/roadmap.html) has been created and added to the ESMValTool website to make the ongoing development activities more visible and transparent.

The workshop was funded by the EU Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the grant agreement No 824084 (IS-ENES3 project).

### <a name="Sea-ice-WS"></a>Workshop "Defining a cutting-edge future for sea ice modelling”
- When: **Sep 24, 2019 09:00 AM to Sep 26, 2019 05:00 PM (UTC / UTC0)**
- Where: **Laugarvatn, Iceland**

![SeaIceGroupPicture](../images/Group_Photo_Sea_Ice_Modelling_WS_Laugarvatn_small.jpg)

The IS-ENES3 workshop “Defining a cutting-edge future for sea ice modelling”, organized by Met Office, CNRS, and DOE, in conjunction with the NEMO Sea Ice Working Group and the CICE Consortium, will take place from the 24th to 26th of September 2019 in Laugarvatn, Iceland.

This workshop proposes to discuss the future evolution and development of sea ice models.

The majority of present-day sea ice models are based upon the continuum model approach that was conceived in the 1970s, and has been successfully used to simulate sea ice within most IPCC-class climate models and short-range forecasting systems since then.
With the progressive increase in model resolution, the most advanced applications of sea ice models now run at up to 100 times finer resolution than the target applications these models were originally designed for. High-resolution applications not only question the underlying physical assumptions but also increasingly push the scaling limits of modern massively-parallel supercomputing architectures. In addition, modern forecast applications are increasingly seeking to resolve more detailed features of the sea ice scape — such as the location of the sea ice edge, individual floes, leads or ridges, fast ice — poorly resolved by current models, which may prove overly simple for such an endeavour.
In light of these present, and future, demands of climate and forecasting systems, we believe that the existing approach to sea ice modelling requires a fresh look.

The workshop will thus bring together representation from across the international sea ice modelling community to explore how our models can match the various needs of the research, climate modelling and operational communities. The questions addressed will be the following:

**Theme 1: Scientific and technical validity/limitations of current models**
1. How relevant are the current continuum model formulations for simulating sea ice in the context of contemporary applications, given the trend towards higher horizontal resolution, the increasingly diverse applications for which sea ice models are employed today, and the warming-related changes in sea ice behaviour?
2. What plausible and useful alternatives could — or should — be adopted instead of the widely used continuum model approach?
3. What opportunities and constraints do the next generation of supercomputers provide for sea ice modelling?

**Theme 2: Physical processes and complexity: bridging the gap between weather and climate requirements**
1. What level of sea ice model complexity is required for climate modelling?
2. Are there any important interactions between sea ice and the rest of the Earth system that are missing from the current models? How should sea ice be coupled with the other components of the climate system?
3. What are the essential physical processes that need to be included for high-resolution sea ice forecasting and reanalysis systems?
4. Are we able to satisfy the potentially conflicting requirements for climate and operational forecasting in a coherent sea ice modelling system?

### <a name="C41-1st"></a>Climate4impact 1st Coding Sprint
- When: **Jun 17, 2019 01:30 PM to Jun 21, 2019 01:00 PM (Europe/Amsterdam / UTC200)**
- Where: **KNMI, De Bilt, Netherlands**

An IS-ENES3 technical meeting will take place from June 18th to June 21st, 2019, dedicated to the development of [the Climate4impact portal (C4I)](https://climate4impact.eu/impactportal/general/index.jsp).

It will be preceded by a collaborative [DARE](http://project-dare.eu/)/IS-ENES3 meeting on June 17th. It will be hosted at KNMI, De Bilt, Netherlands.

The main objectives of these two complementary meetings are to enable partners, involved in the development of the ENES Climate Data Infrastructure and especially on climate4impact, to work together on specific items, with high collaboration and dedicated full time.

It will consist of brainstorming sessions, followed by coding and developments, and a summary of achievements. The brainstorming will be an opportunity to discuss the overall architecture, identifying parts where there is a need of developments and decisions. The actual coding and development sessions will happen in focused groups on identified specific points in the brainstorming session. The summary will be the opportunity to discuss problems and bottlenecks encountered.

The meeting will focus on C4I related work and tasks, but not only as it is also the opportunity to develop other parts of the ENES infrastructure that C4I will use. The evaluation of the DARE Platform, made by C4I and people developing solutions for workflows and data processing of climate data, will also act as a dissemination event as this platform can be used within the ENES CDI.
