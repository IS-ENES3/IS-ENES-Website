### Objectives

IS-ENES2 will:

**Foster the integration of the European Climate and Earth system modeling community**
- Strengthen ENES governance, further developing its strategy, especially with regards to model evaluation and model developments
- Stimulate interactions between global and regional climate modeling communities
Develop training

**Enhance the development of Earth System Models for the understanding of climate variability and change**
- Network on future model developments required to improve model quality and use of future computing architectures
- Stimulate common software developments and providing a service on models and tools

**Support high-end simulations enabling us to better understand and predict climate variations and change**
- Prepare for future exascale computing architectures
- Prepare multi-model high resolution common experiments on the European PRACE high-performance computer facilities
- Stimulate collaboration with ICT companies

**Facilitate the application of Earth system model simulations to better predict and understand climate change impacts on society**
- Enhance the dissemination of model results from both global and regional model experiments
- Develop an interface dedicated to the climate impact community and improving the quality of information on simulations through metadata developments and guidance to users
- Enhance interaction between the climate modelling activity and users from companies and the emerging climate services

### Description of Work

IS-ENES2 is structured into 11 workpackages, 5 Networking Activities (NA), 2 Service Activities (SA), 3 Joint Research Activities (JRA) and one workpackage dedicated to the project coordination & management.

*Here is a schematic representation of IS-ENES2 objectives and organisation of work packages:*

![diagram](../images/Diagram_IS-ENES3_DoW.png)

*List of IS-ENES2 Work Packages:*

**WP1: Scientific and technical coordination of IS-ENES2**
This work package will ensure an effective, smooth and high-quality implementation of the project, with respect to both general administrative and management practices that are expected for projects funded via the EC programmes, and with respect to financial management.

**Networking activities:**

- **NA1 (WP2): ENES strategy**
This work package aims at strengthening the integration of the ENES community.

- **NA2 (WP3): Towards next generation models**
This work package will stimulate interactions among the community to prepare future generations of climate models.

- **NA3 (WP4): Earth System Modelling Environments**
This work package wil complement NA2 by focusing on the model environment tools that are required to develop, run and exploit ESMs.

- **NA4 (WP5): Data Networking**
This work package wil focus on data and metadata networking.

- **NA5 (WP6): Innovating on climate modelling**
This work package will focus on innovation for climate modeling.


**Service activities**

- **SA1 (WP7): The European Network of geographically distributed services on Earth System models, component models and tools**
It expands from IS-ENES1 service covering a wider range of services of models, with a minimum service for all 7 CMIP5 models offering expert contact to answer specific questions on models.

- **SA2 (WP8): ENES Climate Data Services**
It is the service on data from the ENES Data Federation.


**Joint research activities**

- **JRA1 (WP9): Multi-model, multi-member high resolution Earth System Models**
It will prepare multi-model multi-member high-resolution simulations for PRACE machines.

- **JRA2 (WP10): Performance benchmarks for coupled climate models**
It will develop benchmarks for HPC and evaluate different coupling technologies.

- **JRA3 (WP11): Developing software infrastructure for data archive services**
It will further develop methodologies and tools for climate data archives and to serve climate impacts.
