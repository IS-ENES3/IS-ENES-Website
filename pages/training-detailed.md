### <a name="ee-school"></a>IS-ENES3 Eastern Europe Spring Schools on Climate data and Impact assessments
- open when: **May 17, 2022**
- duration: **May 17, 2022 08:30 AM to May 19, 2022 07:00 PM (Europe/Vienna / UTC200)**

The Babeș-Bolyai University (BBU), Faculty of Geography, in collaboration with IS-ENES3, organises two parallel schools (with one common day) targeted to climate and impact researchers from Eastern Europe on 17-19th May 2022 in Cluj-Napoca, Romania.

Climate change is seen as one of the biggest challenges in our times. To be able to do climate change impact studies and to adapt to climate change the knowledge of many different disciplines is needed and knowledge on climate data and experience on analyzing and processing climate data is needed. During the spring school, organised by the Babeş-Bolyai University and the IS-ENES3 project, climate and impact researchers and students will be able to get practical experience with analyzing and processing climate data and with working together on an impact study.

The aim of the schools is to:

- get more knowledge about the various types of climate data and tools/methods to analyse/process them and get experience in using these tools/methods/data;
- learn what is needed for interdisciplinary impact/adaptation studies on climate change;
- create/broaden network on climate change and impact assessments

**The programme, practical details information and application procedure are available on the** [BBU website](https://geografie.ubbcluj.ro/cercetare/?page_id=557).

### <a name="virt-clinic"></a>IS-ENES3 Virtual clinic on bias-adjustment of climate model data
- open when: **Oct 14, 2021**
- duration: **Oct 14, 2021 10:00 AM to Oct 21, 2021 12:00 PM (Europe/Vienna / UTC200)**

**Dates of the clinic**

The virtual clinic is divided into two meetings.
- 14th October 2021 10:00-12:00 CET
- 21st October 2021 10:00-12:00 CET

##### Background

For many studies on the impacts of climate change, bias-adjustment of the climate model simulations is a necessary step before impact models can be run or before relevant climate indices can be calculated. However, there are many methods, all with their own advantages and disadvantages. As part of the IS-ENES3 project, 3 courses on “Climate data for impact assessments” were organized, in which also some attention was paid to bias-adjustment (by Ana Casanueva, University of Cantabria). However, it was clear that the participants of the schools wanted some more in-depth information and practical exercises.

##### Who can participate

Everyone interested ! However, the workshop is meant especially for **climate researchers, impact researchers and climate service providers** who may have to do bias-adjustments or use/will use bias-adjusted climate model data.

##### Set-up the clinic

- During the first meeting, two experts in the field of bias-adjustments will give more in-depth information about e.g. quantile mapping, bias adjustment of precipitation, multivariate methods, challenges, limitations and pitfalls and non-stationary methods.
- In between the two meetings, participants are asked to either explore some tools, do an exercise that will be provided or send in an example/problem/question from their own work on bias adjustments or with bias-adjusted data.
- During the second meeting, problems and challenges of participants with bias-adjustments will be discussed, either from their own work, tools they used or the exercise that was provided during the first meeting.

##### Speakers

- **Mathieu Vrac**: Head of the ESTIMR (Extremes - Statistics - Impacts - Regionalization) group, Directeur de Recherches CNRS (Senior Research scientist) at LSCE-IPSL/CNRS
- **Douglas Maraun**: Associate Professor at the Wegener Center for Climate and Global Change and head of the Regional Climate Research Group at the University of Graz

**Register** [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdChe9gsMkxACd4_Muny9yz5SbmwN820OsPbwWR6RmxEP-DdA/viewform) before October 12!

### <a name="xios"></a>XIOS training sessions
- open when: **Mar 15, 2021**
- duration: **Mar 15, 2021 02:00 PM to Apr 16, 2021 05:00 PM (Europe/Vienna / UTC100)**

The XIOS team will open two online training sessions on XIOS and dr2xml.

The first session will take place from **2pm to 5pm CET on March 15th to 19th 2021** and the second one is planned for **April 12th - 16th 2021**.

This training session will include presentations of XIOS & dr2xml and most importantly several hands-on exercises.

A dedicated webpage for this training is available [here](https://forge.ipsl.jussieu.fr/ioserver/wiki/training_2020) and information will be updated regularly including a more detailed program of the training and slides.

**The slides used for the training sessions are available [here](http://forge.ipsl.jussieu.fr/ioserver/wiki/training_2020) !**

#### What is XIOS:

The climate simulation models launched on super-computers produce a significant amount of data. At this scale, the management of output files and post-treatment on data become the  performance bottleneck for those climate models. In order to generate efficiently the output from models while taking advantage of the calculate resources, Institut Pierre Simon Laplace has launched the XIOS project.

XIOS is a library dedicated to generate efficiently and easily the parallel input/output of climate models. It uses a client-server methodology in which clients (or models) will simulate the physics and send data asynchronously to servers. It is the XIOS servers who are in charge of writing data to files. In this way, we can smooth the I/O peaks by sending to servers a constant data flux all along the simulations and the I/O is overlapped with calculates.

What's more, XIOS provides multiple functionalities which allow an "in situ" data post-treatment. For example, we can read the data from models, operate transformations on those data, combine data from different source models, and send results to multiple output files. All these operations are defined from an external XML file with a very compact and flexible way. Any modifications in this XML file will not require re-compilation of XIOS or models.

XIOS is written in C++ and uses MPI for asynchronous communications between clients and servers. NETCDF, HDF5, and MPIIO are also used in XIOS for efficient file writing.

#### What is dr2xml:

DR2XML is a python package useful for climate models whose I/O are handled by XIOS. It has been originally designed to facilitate the configuration of XIOS (automatic generation of XML files) so as to fully satisfy the CMIP6 DataRequest. With DR2XML, the NetCDF files output by the model are directly CMOR3 compliant.  Some extended functionalities were also developed so that DR2XML enables the user to set up his own Data Request. Consequently DR2XML can be used to customize the official CMIP6 DR or even to work off the CMIP6 framework, but benefiting from the CF-NetCDF, CMOR, and CMIP6 standards (file naming convention, file structure, variable definitions, file and variable attributes, etc.).

#### Registration to the training:

**Summary of the IS-ENES3 project: Infrastructure for the European Network for Earth System Modelling (2019 - 2022)**

IS-ENES3, a Horizon 2020 project, is the third phase of the distributed e-infrastructure of the European Network for Earth System Modelling (ENES). The project fosters collaboration between 22 European climate research institutions. The community aims to develop a better understanding of past, present and future climate. IS-ENES3 projects future variability and changes of the climate through the development and sharing of model components, modelling tools and data infrastructure. The IS-ENES3 three main objectives are to:
- Foster collaboration among the modelling groups to speed-up the development and use of models of the complex Earth’s climate system, generally named “Earth System models” (ESMs);
- Deliver common strategies for the research infrastructure on the global climate;
- Disseminate model data to researchers worldwide.

### <a name="EGU2019-C4I"></a>EGU 2019: First demonstration session Climate4Impact portal for the IS-ENES3 project
- When: **Apr 09, 2019 from 08:03 AM to 10:15 AM (Europe/Vienna / UTC200)**
- Where: **EGU2019, Vienna, Austria**

The Climate4impact portal was developed in the two previous phases of the IS-ENES project. With the start of the IS-ENES3 project in January 2019, this portal for accessing, visualizing and processing climate data will be further developed and updated. To promote the use of the portal, a considerable number of demonstrations sessions and short trainings will be given.

The first demonstration sessions of about an hour each were organized during **splinter sessions at the EGU on Tuesday April 9, 2019.**

Wim Som de Cerff and Maarten Plieger gave short demonstrations after which the participants had some time to explore the portal with the help of an example. A **step-by-step guide** with information on how to login, download data and some further examples on how to process and visualize data was sent to the participants to make it easier for them to explore the portal further. A **follow-up webinar** will be organized where participants can ask further questions and where we like to collect feedback on the portal for further developments.
