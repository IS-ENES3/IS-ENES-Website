IS-ENES offers services on European global climate models, on the NEMO European ocean platform and on several modelling software tools. These services are intended for:

- **Model developers**, providing access to several full Earth system models, access to tools such as the OASIS coupler, the XIOS IO server, the CYLC meta-scheduler, and

- **Users of climate model data**, providing access to the documentation of the European climate models engaged in CMIP simulations as well as software tools for post-processing with the CDO operators and the ESMValTool diagnostic package.
